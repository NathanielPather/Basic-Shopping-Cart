<h1>Basic Shopping Cart - Job Application Task</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
This is a simple task assigned to me during a job interview. The task was to write a PHP class for a shopping cart.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The cart will need to keep its “state” during page loads / refreshes</li>
    <li>List Products – these should be listed at all times to allow adding of products</li>
    <li>Products should be listed in this format: product name, price, link to add product</li>
    <li>Must be able to add a product to the cart</li>
    <li>Must be able to view current products in the cart</li>
    <li>Cart products should be listed in this format: product name, price, quantity, total, remove link</li>
    <li>Product totals should be tallied to give an overall total</li>
    <li>Must be able to remove a product from the cart</li>
    <li>Adding an existing product will only update existing cart product quantity (e.g. adding the same product twice will NOT create two cart items)</li>
    <li>All prices should be displayed to 2 decimal places</li>
    <li>Error checking will be set to strict for viewing completed code</li>
    <li>Project will work as expected in PHP 7.0+</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All requirements achieved.</li>
      <li>Tested with PHP 7.3.</li>
    </ul>
